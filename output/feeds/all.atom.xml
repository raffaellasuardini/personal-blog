&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think is open source?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first heard of open source, I had this strange picture in my head of a group of really intelligent people who work alone and sometimes share some thoughts with the community. Something important and serious. Like Arthur and the knight of the rounded table. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I see open source as an incredible group of people that gives you a hand when you ask for help and also encourages you to join, theyâ€™re really enjoy welcoming new members, and not only do they see it as a helpful resource but they truly believe in the changes that new presence could bring. 
Am I being too romantic?? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to dream :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really understand how difficult the offline world can be, so I know that not everyone can have the same point of view, but I think with some sincere desire to understand each other, we can work on creating something together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Djangonaut Space related with just open source work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my first desires after being accepted into the &lt;a href="https://djangonaut.space/"&gt;Djangonaut Spce program&lt;/a&gt; was to upgrade my skills. This was my first time joining a community, so I didnâ€™t know exactly how things worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the program, I discovered the joy of being part of a community. I made many connections with wonderful people who shared the same desire to enrich our (Djangonaut) space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working to contribute to open-source projects is always rewarding, but I also discovered many different ways to enjoy my journey in the Djangonaut Space program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@djangonautspace/videos"&gt;inside talks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing 'Updates to Django' in Django Newsletter (see the time &lt;a href="https://django-news.com/issues/240?#start"&gt;I welcoming myself&lt;/a&gt; to become a new contributor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing my first blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizer a bi-monthly meeting inside the Djangonaut Space Discord server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to thank this fantastic community because with their encouragement I was also being able to attend for the first time &lt;a href="https://2024.djangocon.eu/"&gt;DjangoCon Europe 2024&lt;/a&gt; in Vigo and make my first lighting talk and last but not least gave my first ever talk at &lt;a href="https://2024.djangoday.dk/"&gt;Django Day Copenhagen 2024&lt;/a&gt;.
Those experience was better than I could ever immagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't wait to attend next DjangoCon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there ðŸš€&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="open source"></category></entry></feed>
