Our session organizer Tobe send us some prompt and I would like to sendd my thoughts.


**What do you think is open source?**

When I first heard of open source, I had this strange picture in my head of a group of really intelligent people who work alone and sometimes share some thoughts with the community. Something important and serious. Like Arthur and the knight of the rounded table. 

Now I see open source as an incredible group of people that gives you a hand when you ask for help and also encourages you to join, theyâ€™re really enjoy welcoming new members, and not only do they see it as a helpful resource but they truly believe in the changes that new presence could bring. 
Am I being too romantic?? 

I like to dream :) 

I really understand how difficult the offline world can be, so I know that not everyone can have the same point of view, but I think with some sincere desire to understand each other, we can work on creating something together.

**Is Djangonaut Space related with just open source work?**

One of my first desires after being accepted into the [Djangonaut Spce program](https://djangonaut.space/) was to upgrade my skills. This was my first time joining a community, so I didnâ€™t know exactly how things worked.

Within the program, I discovered the joy of being part of a community. I made many connections with wonderful people who shared the same desire to enrich our (Djangonaut) space. 

Working to contribute to open-source projects is always rewarding, but I also discovered many different ways to enjoy my journey in the Djangonaut Space program:

- [inside talks](https://www.youtube.com/@djangonautspace/videos)
- writing 'Updates to Django' in Django Newsletter (see the time [I welcoming myself](https://django-news.com/issues/240?#start) to become a new contributor)
- Writing my first blog
- Organizer a bi-monthly meeting inside the Djangonaut Space Discord server

I need to thank this fantastic community because with their encouragement I was also being able to attend for the first time [DjangoCon Europe 2024](https://2024.djangocon.eu/) in Vigo and make my first lighting talk and last but not least gave my first ever talk at [Django Day Copenhagen 2024](https://2024.djangoday.dk/).
Those experience was better than I could ever immagine.

I can't wait to attend next DjangoCon. 

See you there ðŸš€
